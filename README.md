## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Conda package manager
- OpenAI API key (for API mode)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Create and activate conda environment**
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate medical_chatbot
   ```

3. **Set up OpenAI API key** (Required for API mode)
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

> **Note**: First loading may take around 1 minute, but subsequent loads will be faster (< 10 seconds)

## 🎮 Usage

### Getting Started

1. Launch the application using `python main.py`
2. Choose your preferred model:
   - **Tree Model**: Local ML-based prediction (faster, offline)
   - **API Model**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo (more conversational, requires internet)
3. Start chatting about your health concerns!

### Model Modes

#### 🌳 Tree Model (Local ML)
- Uses Random Forest and SVM classifiers
- Trained on medical datasets
- Provides disease predictions based on symptoms
- Works offline
- Includes medicine information lookup

#### 🤖 API Model (OpenAI)
- Powered by GPT-3.5-turbo
- More conversational and context-aware
- Requires OpenAI API key
- Online connectivity required

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Machine Learning Models

- **Random Forest Classifier**: Primary prediction model
- **Support Vector Machine**: Secondary prediction model
- **Training Data**: Kaggle medical dataset with symptom-disease mappings
- **Features**: 132 symptom features for disease classification

### Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `main.py` | Application launcher with PyQt5 setup |
| `gui.py` | Complete GUI implementation with chat interface |
| `middleware.py` | Smart routing between Tree and API models |
| `tree_model_medicine.py` | ML-based disease prediction engine |
| `api_model.py` | OpenAI GPT integration with conversation history |

### Data Sources

- **Training Dataset**: Comprehensive symptom-disease mapping
- **Medicine Database**: 17MB database with medicine information
- **Symptom Descriptions**: Detailed disease information
- **Precautions**: Medical advice and precautionary measures

## 🖥️ Platform Compatibility

- **macOS**: Optimal experience (recommended)
- **Windows**: Fully functional with minor GUI sizing differences
- **Linux**: Compatible (requires Qt5 dependencies)

## 🔬 Model Performance

The project includes detailed model analysis in `inference_model_training.ipynb` showing:
- Accuracy comparisons between different algorithms
- Feature importance analysis
- Cross-validation results
- Performance metrics visualization

## 🚧 Optional Features

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

The `RAG_code/` directory contains enhanced versions with retrieval-augmented generation:
- `api_model_rag.py`: RAG-enhanced OpenAI integration
- `middleware_rag.py`: RAG-specific middleware

> **Note**: RAG features are separate to maintain cost efficiency and performance in the main application.

## 🛠️ Development

### Training New Models

To retrain the machine learning models:

```bash
python disease_prediction_model_generator.py
```

This will generate new `rfc.model` and `svc.model` files in the `model/` directory.

### Model Analysis

Open `inference_model_training.ipynb` in Jupyter to:
- Analyze model performance
- Visualize accuracy metrics
- Compare different algorithms
- Explore feature importance
