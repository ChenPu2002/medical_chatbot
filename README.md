*An intelligent medical chatbot that combines machine learning and AI to provide personalized health assistance*

**🏗️ Developed in Hong Kong, April 2024**

</div>

## 📅 Project Timeline & Important Notes

This project was developed in **Hong Kong during April 2024**, when OpenAI's API was still directly accessible from Hong Kong. 

> **⚠️ Important**: As of late 2024, OpenAI API access from Hong Kong has been restricted. If you're running this project from Hong Kong or other restricted regions, you may need to:
> - Use a VPN service to access OpenAI API
> - Consider alternative API providers
> - Use only the local Tree Model mode (which works offline)

The local Tree Model provides full functionality without requiring external API access.

## 🌟 Features

- **🤖 Dual AI System**: Choose between local ML models (Random Forest/SVM) and OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
- **🎯 Disease Prediction**: Symptom-based disease prediction using trained machine learning models
- **💊 Medicine Information**: Comprehensive medicine database with usage information
- **🖥️ Modern GUI**: Beautiful PyQt5 interface with web-based chat display
- **🔍 Smart Search**: Fuzzy matching for symptom recognition and spell correction
- **📊 Model Visualization**: Jupyter notebook with model accuracy analysis
- **🔧 RAG Support**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for enhanced responses (optional)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Conda package manager
- OpenAI API key (for API mode)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   # Replace 'your-username' with your GitHub username if you have forked the repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical_chatbot.git
   cd medical_chatbot
   ```

2. **Create and activate conda environment**
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate medical_chatbot
   ```

3. **Set up OpenAI API key** (Required for API mode)

   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your key:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # then edit .env and set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_key
   ```

   > **🌏 Regional Note**: If you're in Hong Kong or other restricted regions, consider using the Tree Model mode instead, which works completely offline.

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

> **Note**: First loading may take around 1 minute, but subsequent loads will be faster (< 10 seconds)

## 🎮 Usage

### Getting Started

1. Launch the application using `python main.py`
2. Choose your preferred model:
   - **Tree Model**: Local ML-based prediction (faster, offline)
   - **API Model**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo (more conversational, requires internet)
3. Start chatting about your health concerns!

### Model Modes

#### 🌳 Tree Model (Local ML)
- Uses Random Forest and SVM classifiers
- Trained on medical datasets
- Provides disease predictions based on symptoms
- Works offline
- Includes medicine information lookup

#### 🤖 API Model (OpenAI)
- Powered by GPT-3.5-turbo
- More conversational and context-aware
- Requires OpenAI API key
- Online connectivity required
